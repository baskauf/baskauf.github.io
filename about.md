# Current job responsibilities

# Personal interests

I enjoy traveling, outdoor activities, and reading. I'm into genealogy and have written two books of family history. Here's some stats:

- I've traveled to all 50 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. I've visited 32 countries on 4 continents.
- I want to visit as many U.S. national parks as possible. So far I've been to 47 (75% of them).
- I'm hoping to eventually observe 1000 species of birds. Currently, [I'm up to 846](https://ebird.org/profile/NzU0NDQ1/world).
- I've recently finished reading all 72 of the winners of the Hugo Award for Best Novel (science fiction or fantasy)
