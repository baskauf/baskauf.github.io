# Background

I have a BA degree in chemistry and biology and a Ph.D. in biology with a focus on insect ecology and evolution.  I have ten years of experience teaching high school in Ohio, Swaziland, and Tennessee, and taught biology at Vanderbilt University from 2000 to 2018.

# Former job responsibilities

In 2024 I retired from my position as a Data Science and Data Curation Specialist in the [Digital Lab](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/digital-lab/) of the [Jean & Alexander Heard Libraries](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/) of [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). 

My work in the Digital Lab involved helping faculty, staff, and students build data skills through workshops, lesson series, individual consulatations, and guest programs in classes. I also worked with librarians across the library system to improve the Libraries' data infrastructure and to help them build their skills. 

You can learn more about some of these efforts through the projects tab.

# Personal interests

I enjoy traveling, outdoor activities, and reading. I'm into genealogy and have written two books of family history. Here's some stats:

- I've traveled to all 50 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. I've visited 33 countries on 5 continents.
- I want to visit as many U.S. national parks as possible. So far I've been to 49 (78% of them).
- I'm hoping to eventually observe 1000 species of birds. Currently, [I'm up to 961](https://ebird.org/profile/NzU0NDQ1/world).
- I've finished reading all 72 of the winners of the Hugo Award for Best Novel and all 60 of the winners of the Nebula Award for Best Novel (both for science fiction or fantasy). You can read about my [favorite Hugo winners](https://baskauf.blogspot.com/2025/02/favorite-hugo-award-winning-novels.html) and [favorite Nebula winners](https://baskauf.blogspot.com/2025/03/favorite-nebula-award-winning-novels.html) in [my blog](https://baskauf.blogspot.com/).
- In 1988, I was the [41st person to complete *Robot Odyssey*](/img/robot_letter.jpg), which has been called "[The Hardest Computer Game of All Time](https://slate.com/technology/2014/01/robot-odyssey-the-hardest-computer-game-of-all-time.html)". After searching for it for over a year, I finally found my certificate -- a status symbol among aging techies.
