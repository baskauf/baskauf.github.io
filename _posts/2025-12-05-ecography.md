Our paper describing the Humboldt Extension to Darwin Core has been published in *Ecography*. The Humboldt Extension adds 55 terms that enrich the Darwin Core, providing the terms needed to capture and share multiple types of biodiversity survey data. The paper illustrates the benefits of implementing the Humboldt Extension with three case studies and demonstrates how richer data can be used in research, modelling, and to inform decision-making.
