Camera trapping is an increasingly important method used by ecologists for monitoring animals in the wild. Camera trap data has previously been difficult to publish by conventional means, since the data includes many related images or videos that must be associated with the occurrence data. The new Camtrap DP standard provides a way to package camera trap data based on the open Frictionless Data Package specification. Camtrap DP datasets can be easily exchanged or published to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) where the included occurrence data will be integrated with biodiversity data collected by other means. 

Publication of our paper describing version 1.0 of the standard is the first step in the process of further development by the camera trapping community, and adoption of the standard under the auspices of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) organization.
