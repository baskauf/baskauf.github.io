My coauthors and I have published a guide to help people understand how to use the new Humboldt Extension for Biological Inventories of the Darwin Core standard. The guide includes diagrams and detailed information about how to structure the data to capture the hierarchical structure typically found in monitoring projects. 

The guide is freely available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license as a web page and in PDF format at <https://docs.gbif.org/guide-publishing-survey-data/en/>
