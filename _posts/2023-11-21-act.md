Charlotte Lew and I have been working for some time to improve access to images in the [Art in the Christian Tradition database](https://diglib.library.vanderbilt.edu/act-search.pl) by linking descriptive metadata in Wikidata to the corresponding artwork images in Wikimedia Commons. In the first part of the project, we were primarily cleaning up and linking Wikidata metadata to images that were already in Commons.

In the most recent phase of the project, we have been working out a workflow for uploading images from the database to Commons. The first batch that we've uploaded are over 900 images that were taken by Anne Richardson (formerly of the Vanderbilt Divinity Library) and Jim Womack (retired art teacher at Montgomery Bell Academy) on various trips to Europe. These images are primarily of cathedral artwork and early Christian art, although there are also some images that are illustrations of the Macklin Bible, one of the holdings of the Vanderbilt Libraries' Special Collections that was a gift to Vanderbilt University from John J. and Anne Czura.

To view the recently uploaded images, you can search Commons for the [category "Art in the Christian Tradition"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Art_in_the_Christian_Tradition).
