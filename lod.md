# Wikidata

I've been an active contributor to Wikidata since 2019 through editing, but also by developiing tools and educational resources to help others use Wikidata more effectively.

## VanderBot

VanderBot is a Python application designed to allow humans to edit Wikidata more effectively using CSV spreadsheets as a data sources. Unlike other tools that use CSVs in the Wikidata upload process, VanderBot maintians a complete record of the state of the data at the time the data are uploaded, making it possible to detect changes over time using federated queries with the Wikidata Query Service.
