# Wikidata

I've been an active contributor to Wikidata since 2019 through editing, but also by developiing tools and educational resources to help others use Wikidata more effectively.

## VanderBot

VanderBot is a Python application designed to allow humans to edit Wikidata more effectively using CSV spreadsheets as a data sources. Unlike other tools that use CSVs in the Wikidata upload process, VanderBot maintians a complete record of the state of the data at the time the data are uploaded, making it possible to detect changes over time using federated queries with the Wikidata Query Service.

For more information about this approach, see [Baskauf and Baskauf, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3233/SW-210443). For more information about the VanderBot script, including tutorials, visit the [VanderBot landing page](http://vanderbi.lt/vanderbot). 

## Learn Wikidata

In 2020, a team of librarians from Vanderbilt received a [WikiCite grant funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikicite/grant/WikiCite_for_Librarians:_Interactive_Learning_Pathways_for_Information_Professionals) to produce a series of interactive learning modules for Wikidata beginners. These self-paced lessons are geared towards information professionals, but usable by anyone.

I contributed to the project through scriptwriting, Twine programming, and workflow management. To try out the lessons, visit <https://learnwikidata.net/> .

## WikiProjects: VandyCite, Fine Arts Gallery, Art in the Christian Tradition

I play a significant role in three ongoing WikiProjects operating out of the Vanderbilt Libraries.

**[WikiProject VandyCite](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_VandyCite)**

Starting in late 2019, I began developing the VanderBot script for the purpose of creating or enhancing Wikidata items about Vanderbilt University researchers and scholars. By July 2020, I had created or curated records for over 4500 researchers, which included all faculty and most postdocs and research staff at the university. (This phase of the project is described more fully [here](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/linked-data/blob/master/vanderbot/researcher-project.md). This led to a broader effort, [WikiProject VandyCite](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_VandyCite), to upload and link publications to these researchers. 

Working with my colleague Charlotte Lew, we have completed creation of all publications with DOIs authored by Divinity School faculty. We will continue to expand this effort to other types of publications and other parts of the university.

Working with [Kali Mason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalimason1/), former registrar and collections manager of the [Vanderbilt University Fine Arts Gallery](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/gallery/), I used data from the [Gallery's ArtStor database](https://library.artstor.org/#/collection/100140247) to create Wikidata items for all 6888 works in the collection.

**[WikiProject Art in the Christian Tradition (ACT)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Art_in_the_Christian_Tradition_(ACT))**
