# Wikidata

I've been an active contributor to Wikidata since 2019 through editing, but also by developiing tools and educational resources to help others use Wikidata more effectively.

## VanderBot

VanderBot is a Python application designed to allow humans to edit Wikidata more effectively using CSV spreadsheets as a data sources. Unlike other tools that use CSVs in the Wikidata upload process, VanderBot maintians a complete record of the state of the data at the time the data are uploaded, making it possible to detect changes over time using federated queries with the Wikidata Query Service.

For more information about this approach, see [Baskauf and Baskauf, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3233/SW-210443). For more information about the VanderBot script, including tutorials, visit the [VanderBot landing page](http://vanderbi.lt/vanderbot). 

## Learn Wikidata

In 2020, a team of librarians from Vanderbilt received a [WikiCite grant funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikicite/grant/WikiCite_for_Librarians:_Interactive_Learning_Pathways_for_Information_Professionals) to produce a series of interactive learning modules for Wikidata beginners. These self-paced lessons are geared towards information professionals, but usable by anyone.
